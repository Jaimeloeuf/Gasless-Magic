                Steps:
                    1) Get all the data needed for the call
                    2) Make the call and get the execution status + return values
                    3) Check if the call succeeded
                        a) Revert all state changes if the call faile
                        b) Return the call's return value to the contract caller as return value

                Getting data needed for the call
                    1) Get the address to be called, this is part of the call data
                    2) Get the function signature and input value(s) for the function to be called from the call data, as 1 full hex

                Expected Calldata:
                    - "Address" of contract to call
                    - "Data" the transaction data to pass to the other contract
                        - The standard transaction data we are calling it directly.
                        - The function selector and the function input

            /* Step (1) Extract data needed, from the call data */
            // Copy the calling data into memory
            // calldatasize is the size of call data in bytes
            // Copy calldatasize amount of bytes from position 0 of calldata to position 0 of memory
            calldatacopy(0, 0, calldatasize)

            // Load all data from storage data starting at address 0
            // The data from storage at position 0, is the variable "address public addr"
            // Bitmask to grab the first 20bytes/40Hex/unint160 of data from the first 32bytes/64Hex of calldata memory slot to get the input address

            // When the "to" field of a transaction is empty, it means that a new contract should be created with the transaction data
            // The user should not send a null address, because we assume that the address is not null during our parsing
            // Maybe frontend should send a variable at the start, so the first Hex acts as a bool, indicating if address is null, before parsing calldata accordingly.
            // The bool will be used to indicate if the operation is for creating contracts or just making a normal contract call
            // The below check wont actually work, because if user send any data, the thing wont be null, it will just treat the data as the address.

            // store it only after shifting it all the way to right to prevent your data from being cut, as sol try to fit it into the type smaller size
