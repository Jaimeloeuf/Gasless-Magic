# Smart Contract Wallet
Smart Contract Wallet is a Blockchain wallet/account that runs as a piece of code on the Blockchain (more specifically, the Ethereum Blockchain) to control your funds. This contrast with the traditionally available EOA (Externally Owned Accounts) which is just a Private/Public Key pair.


## Main features
- Gasless wallet deployment
    - As a smart contract wallet is a smart contract, deployment of a smart contract wallet requires gas from the deploying party, thus to remove this UX barrier especially for users who just encountered blockchain for the first time, a Gasless deployment system will be used.
    - Basically the deployment party of the wallet will be Torus which to the user will be invisible and free.
    - Done using meta transaction and CREATE2
- Gas Abstraction
    - Where the Smart Contract wallet provider pays for the user's gas to increase user adoption
    - Done with Meta transactions
    - Invisible to the user, and does not require any work on the user's end
- Integration with Torus wallet (Web2.0 convenience for Web3.0)
    - Integrates with the well established Torus EOA "wallet" that gives you the ease of use of Web2.0 systems like Google Logins for Web3.0 softwares.

## Project Structure
- proxy_contract_test/
    - Directory that holds its own smart contracts for testing proxy contracts out, with basic functionality to make sure the proxy contract works first.
- contracts/
    - Directory for all the smart contracts of this Smart Contract Wallet
    - Basically what will be deployed.


## Q&A
- Who will pay for the smart contract wallet deployment?
    - Torus (The service behind the wallet) will pay for the creation of the user's smart contract wallet, so it will seem as if there is no fee.
    - Torus pays for it as Customer/User acquisition fee
- How to interact with the wallet?
    - To interact with the smart contract wallet, you would need your own EOA which acts as a proof of your identity
        - You need to have your own private key (From your EOA or Public/Private key pair whatever you prefer)
        - Your private key will be used to proof your own identity when you interact with the Smart Contract
        - This EOA part is essentially already provided by the current Torus wallet
    - Flow of action
        - It is an EOA that interacts with the smart contract wallet,
        - you sign Tx to show proof that you approve of that Tx
        - Send the Signed Tx to the recepient off chain
        - Recepient signs it and submits it to the Tx pool for the smart contract wallet to execute it
        - The SW sees the incoming transaction, and determines if the original signature belongs to the owner of the SW.
            - If it is true, send the value over to the address that submitted the Tx
            - But since the Tx was sent to the Tx pool by the recepient, the recepient pays for the Gas fee.
- Who pays for the Gas when user makes a payment transaction?
    - The user should pay for their own gas if they are making a payment transaction
- Who pays for the Gas when user makes a transaction to interact with a dApp?
    - Ideally the dApp should pay for the gas
